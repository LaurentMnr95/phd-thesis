	abstract     = {Solving for adversarial examples with projected gradient descent has been demonstrated to be highly effective in fooling the neural network based classifiers. However, in the black-box setting, the attacker is limited only to the query access to the network and solving for a successful adversarial example becomes much more difficult. To this end, recent methods aim at estimating the true gradient signal based on the input queries but at the cost of excessive queries. We propose an efficient discrete surrogate to the optimization problem which does not require estimating the gradient and consequently becomes free of the first order update hyperparameters to tune. Our experiments on Cifar-10 and ImageNet show the state of the art black-box attack performance with significant reduction in the required queries compared to a number of recently proposed methods.

We provide a summary and some new results concerning bounds among some important probability metrics/distances that are used by statisticians and probabilists. Knowledge of other metrics can provide a means of deriving bounds for another one in an applied problem. Considering other metrics can also provide alternate insights. We also give examples that show that rates of convergence can strongly depend on the metric chosen. Careful consideration is necessary when choosing a metric.}

Two further heuristics are introduced: pairwise selection selects at most one of two mirrored vectors in order to avoid a bias due to recombination. Selective mirroring only mirrors the worst solutions of the population. Convergence rates on the sphere function are derived that also yield upper bounds for the convergence rate on any spherical function. The optimal fraction of offspring to be mirrored is regardless of pairwise selection one without selective mirroring and about 19\% with selective mirroring, where the convergence rate reaches a value of 0.390. This is an improvement of 56\% compared to the best known convergence rate of 0.25 with positive recombination weights.},

	abstract     = {Cigar functions are convex quadratic functions that are characterised by the presence of only two distinct eigenvalues of their Hessian, the smaller one of which occurs with multiplicity one. Their ridge-like topology makes them a useful test case for optimisation strategies. This paper extends previous work on modelling the behaviour of evolution strategies with isotropically distributed mutations optimising cigar functions by considering weighted recombination as well as the effects of noise on optimisation performance. It is found that the same weights that have previously been seen to be optimal for the sphere and parabolic ridge functions are optimal for cigar functions as well. The influence of the presence of noise on optimisation performance depends qualitatively on the trajectory of the search point, which in turn is determined by the strategy's mutation strength as well as its population size and recombination weights. Analytical results are obtained for the case of cumulative step length adaptation.},

We show mathematically that this bound is tight, for any family of functions that includes sphere functions, at least for a wide set of Evolution Strategies without large mutations.},

The aggregation averages over the versions when predicting a numerical outcome and does a plurality vote when predicting a class. The multiple versions are formed by making bootstrap replicates of the learning set and using these as new learning sets. Tests on real and simulated data sets using classification and regression trees and subset selection in linear regression show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy. The vital element is the instability of the prediction method. If perturbing the learning set can cause significant changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging can improve accuracy.},

We train a Recurrent Neural Network controller to generate a string in a specific domain language that describes a mathematical update equation based on a list of primitive functions, such as the gradient, running average of the gradient, etc. The controller is trained with Reinforcement Learning to maximize the performance of a model after a few epochs. On CIFAR-10, our method discovers several update rules that are better than many commonly used optimizers, such as Adam, RMSProp, or SGD with and without Momentum on a ConvNet model. These optimizers can also be transferred to perform well on different neural network architectures, including Google’s neural machine translation system.}

The problem of the optimal population size depending on the parameter space dimension N is solved. A method extending the results obtained for the spherical model to nonspherical success domains is presented.The power of sexuality is discussed and it is shown that this power does not stem mainly from the “combination” of “good properties” of the mates (building block hypothesis) but rather from genetic repair diminishing the influence of harmful mutations. The dominant recombination is analyzed by introduction of surrogate mutations leading to the concept of species. Conclusions for evolutionary algorithms (EAs), including genetic algorithms (GAs), are drawn.},

The covariance matrix is constrained to be diagonal and the resulting algorithm, sep-CMA-ES, samples each coordinate independently. Because the model complexity is reduced, the learning rate for the covariance matrix can be increased. Consequently, on essentially separable functions, sep-CMA-ES significantly outperforms CMA-ES. For dimensions larger than a hundred, even on the non-separable Rosenbrock function, the sep-CMA-ES needs fewer function evaluations than CMA-ES.},

These simulations can be divided into two groups: (1) those that model chromosomes and emphasize genetic operators; and (2) those that model individuals or populations and emphasize the adaptation and diversity of behavior. Recent claims have suggested that genetic models using recombination operators, specifically crossover, are typically more efficient and effective at function optimization than behavioral models that rely solely on mutation. These claims are assessed empirically on a broad range of response surfaces.}

	abstract     = {Niching techniques are the extension of standard evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to multi-modal domains, in scenarios where the location of multiple optima is targeted and where EAs tend to lose population diversity and converge to a solitary basin of attraction. The development and investigation of EA niching methods have been carried out for several decades, primarily within the branches of genetic algorithms (GAs) and evolution strategies (ES). This research yielded altogether a long list of algorithmic approaches, some of which are bio-inspired by various concepts of organic speciation and ecological niches, while others are more computational-oriented. This chapter will lay the theoretical foundations for niching, from the perspectives of biology as well as optimization, provide a summary of the main contemporary niching techniques within EAs, and discuss the topic of experimental methodology for niching techniques. This will be accompanied by the discussion of specific case-studies, including the employment of the popular covariance matrix adaptation ES within a niching framework, the application to real-world problems, and the treatment of the so-called niche radius problem.},

The derivation of the progress rate formula is sketched, its predictions are compared with experiments, and its limitations are shown. The dynamical behavior of the ES is investigated. It will be shown that standard self-adaptation has considerable problems to drive the ES in its optimum working regime. Remedies are provided to improve the self-adaptation.}

	abstract     = {Artificial intelligence in games often leads to the problem of parameter tuning. Some heuristics may have coefficients, and they should be tuned to maximize the win rate of the program. A possible approach is to build local quadratic models of the win rate as a function of program parameters. Many local regression algorithms have already been proposed for this task, but they are usually not sufficiently robust to deal automatically and efficiently with very noisy outputs and non-negative Hessians. The CLOP principle, which stands for Confident Local OPtimization, is a new approach to local regression that overcomes all these problems in a straightforward and efficient way. CLOP discards samples of which the estimated value is confidently inferior to the mean of all samples. Experiments demonstrate that, when the function to be optimized is smooth, this method outperforms all other tested algorithms.}

(Standard jackknife theory gives an approximate mean and variance in the case R(X, F) = θ(F̂) - θ(F), θ some parameter of interest.) A general method, called the "bootstrap," is introduced, and shown to work satisfactorily on a variety of estimation problems. The jackknife is shown to be a linear approximation method for the bootstrap. The exposition proceeds by a series of examples: variance of the sample median, error rates in a linear discriminant analysis, ratio estimation, estimating regression parameters, etc.}},

Each iteration forms linear approximations to the objective and constraint functions by interpolation at the vertices of a simplex and a trust region bound restricts each change to the variables. Thus a new vector of variables is calculated, which may replace one of the current vertices, either to improve the shape of the simplex or because it is the best vector that has been found so far, according to a merit function that gives attention to the greatest constraint violation. The trust region radius $\rho$ is never increased, and it is reduced when the approximations of a well-conditioned simplex fail to yield an improvement to the variables, until $\rho$ reaches a prescribed value that controls the final accuracy. Some convergence properties and several numerical results are given, but there are no more than 9 variables in these calculations because linear approximations can be highly inefficient. Nevertheless, the algorithm is easy to use for small numbers of variables.},

	abstract     = {An important factor in the successful application of evolutionary techniques to real-world problems is the incorporation of domain knowledge. One form such knowledge often takes is the possession of one or more high-quality solutions. Non-random initialisation, or inoculation, of the population in an evolutionary algorithm provides a way to incorporate such knowledge. A body of folklore about the methods and results of such initialisation techniques exists, but is largely unwritten and unquantified. This paper discusses the need for hybridisation, through whatever means, and concentrates on the potential offered by seeding the initial population with extant good solutions. Such ideas also have implications for algorithmic restarts after convergence. Experiments conducted using a number of real industrial and commercial problems confirm some of the accepted folklore, and highlight several interesting new results. In particular, it is found that both average solution quality and run-times improve when reasonable inoculation strategies are used, but that the quality of the best solution found over a number of runs often deteriorates as the initial populations become less random.}

Nevertheless, it is plagued with some drawbacks like the complexity of the adaptation process and the reliance on a number of sophisticatedly constructed strategy parameter formulae for which no or little theoretical substantiation is available. Furthermore, the CMA-ES does not work well for large population sizes. In this paper, we propose an alternative -- simpler -- adaptation step of the covariance matrix which is closer to the ``traditional'' mutative self-adaptation. We compare the newly proposed algorithm, which we term the CMSA-ES, with the CMA-ES on a number of different test functions and are able to demonstrate its superiority in particular for large population sizes.},

	abstract     = {In many engineering optimization problems, the number of function evaluations is severely limited by time or cost. These problems pose a special challenge to the field of global optimization, since existing methods often require more function evaluations than can be comfortably afforded. One way to address this challenge is to fit response surfaces to data collected by evaluating the objective and constraint functions at a few points. These surfaces can then be used for visualization, tradeoff analysis, and optimization. In this paper, we introduce the reader to a response surface methodology that is especially good at modeling the nonlinear, multimodal functions that often occur in engineering. We then show how these approximating functions can be used to construct an efficient global optimization algorithm with a credible stopping rule. The key to using response surfaces for global optimization lies in balancing the need to exploit the approximating surface (by sampling where it is minimized) with the need to improve the approximation (by sampling where prediction error may be high). Striking this balance requires solving certain auxiliary problems which have previously been considered intractable, but we show how these computational obstacles can be overcome.},

In this paper we show that PSO appears to work well on {"}single-funnel{"} optimization functions. On more complex optimization problems, PSO tends to converge too quickly and then fail to make further progress. We contend that most benchmarks for PSO have classically been demonstrated on single-funnel functions. However, in practice, optimization tasks are more complex and possess higher problem dimensionality. We present empirical results that support our conjecture that PSO performs well on single-funnel functions but tends to stagnate on more complicated landscapes.},

This is achieved by gathering images of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context. Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model.},

The proposed strategy is based on reducing the dispersion of the generated set of samples. We defined a forbidden range around each selected sample and ignored this region in further sampling. The resultant planner, called low dispersion-PRM, is an effective multi-query sampling-based planner that is able to solve motion planning queries with smaller graphs. Simulation results indicated that the proposed planner improved the performance of the original PRM and other low-dispersion variants of PRM. Furthermore, the proposed planner is able to solve difficult motion planning instances, including narrow passages and bug traps, which represent particularly difficult tasks for classic sampling-based algorithms. For measuring the uniformity of the generated samples, a new algorithm was created to measure the dispersion of a set of samples based on a predetermined resolution.}

	abstract     = {The Halton sequence is one of the classical low-discrepancy sequences. It is effectively used in numerical integration when the dimension is small, however, for larger dimensions, the uniformity of the sequence quickly degrades. As a remedy, generalized (scrambled) Halton sequences have been introduced by several researchers since the 1970s. In a generalized Halton sequence, the digits of the original Halton sequence are permuted using a carefully selected permutation. Some of the permutations in the literature are designed to minimize some measure of discrepancy, and some are obtained heuristically.In this paper, we investigate how these carefully selected permutations differ from a permutation simply generated at random. We use a recent genetic algorithm, test problems from numerical integration, and a recent randomized quasi-Monte Carlo method, to compare generalized Halton sequences with randomly chosen permutations, with the traditional generalized Halton sequences. Numerical results suggest that the random permutation approach is as good as, or better than, the ``best'' deterministic permutations.},

It is shown that under weak assumptions on the objective function the linear convergence rate of the gradient method can be transferred to these stochastic algorithms.}

It provides a formal privacy guarantee, ensuring that sensitive information relative to individuals cannot be easily inferred by disclosing answers to aggregate queries. If two databases are adjacent, i.e. differ only for an individual, then the query should not allow to tell them apart by more than a certain factor. This induces a bound also on the distinguishability of two generic databases, which is determined by their distance on the Hamming graph of the adjacency relation.}

In such a database, a query consists of a pair (S, f) where S is a set of rows in the database and f is a function mapping database rows to 0, 1. The true response is r∈S f(DBr), a noisy version of which is released. Results of Dinur, Dwork, and Nissim show that a strong form of privacy can be maintained using a surprisingly small amount of noise – much less than the sampling error – provided the total number of queries is sublinear in the number of database rows. We call this query and (slightly) noisy reply the SuLQ (Sub-Linear Queries) primitive. The assumption of sublinearity becomes reasonable as databases grow increasingly large. We extend this work in two ways. First, we modify the privacy analysis to real-valued functions f. Second, we examine the computational power of the SuLQ primitive. We show that it is very powerful indeed, in that slightly noisy versons of the following computations can be carried out with very few invocations of the primitive: principal component analysis, k means clustering, the ID3 algorithm, the perceptron algorithm, and (apparently!) all algorithms in the statistical queries learning model.},

	abstract     = {Image super-resolution (SR) techniques improve various remote sensing applications by allowing for finer spatial details than those captured by the original acquisition sensors. Recent advances in deep learning bring a new opportunity for SR by learning the mapping from low to high resolution. The most used convolutional neural networks (CNN) based approaches are prone to excessive smoothing or blurring due to the optimization objective in mean squared error (MSE). Instead, generative adversarial network (GAN) based approaches can achieve more perceptually acceptable results. However, the preliminary design of GANs generator with simple direct- or skip-connection residual blocks compromises its SR potential. Emerging dense convolutional network (DenseNet) equipped with dense connections has shown a promising prospect in classification and super-resolution. An intuitive idea to introduce DenseNet into GAN is expected to boost SR performance. However, because convolutional kernels in the existing residual block are arranged into a one-dimensional flat structure, the formation of dense connections highly relies on skip connections (linking the current layer to all subsequent layers with a shortcut path). In order to increase connection density, the depth of the layer has to be accordingly expanded, which in turn results in training difficulties such as vanishing gradient and information propagation loss. To this end, this paper proposes an ultra-dense GAN (udGAN) for image SR, where we reform the internal layout of the residual block into a two-dimensional matrix topology. This topology can provide additional diagonal connections so that we can still accomplish enough pathways with fewer layers. In particular, the pathways are almost doubled compared to previous dense connections under the same number of layers. The achievable rich connections are flexibly adapted to the diversity of image content, thus leading to improved SR performance. Extensive experiments on public benchmark datasets and real-world satellite imagery show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art counterparts in both subjective and quantitative assessments, especially those related to perception.}

For this model, under suitable complexity assumptions, it is proved that extracting any information about the cleartext from the cyphertext is hard on the average for an adversary with polynomially bounded computational resources. The proof holds for any message space with any probability distribution. The first implementation of this model is presented. The security of this implementation is proved under the interactability assumptin of deciding Quadratic Residuosity modulo composite numbers whose factorization is unknown.}

	abstract     = {Island models (IMs) are a class of distributed evolutionary algorithms (EAs) in which the population is split into multiple sub-populations called islands. Separate EAs run independently on each island, but they interact by means of migrating individuals. Therefore, IMs are different both from a single-population standard EA, as well as from a set of multiple isolated EAs. IMs are interesting for several reasons. They have been reported to yield better results than standard EAs. IMs are also advantageous when computational tasks must be distributed across multiple machines because their structure is easy to parallelize. However, despite many studies, no comprehensive theory describing their behavior has been developed. Due to the lack of theory and a complex architecture with many control parameters, setting up IMs has been a trial-and-error process, guided mostly by “rules of thumb.” In this dissertation, I adopt a two-level (intra- and inter-island) view of IMs and show how this approach makes understanding their dynamics easier. They behave very differently than standard EAs, and in order to take full advantage of this, I propose a better utilization of the inter-island level of evolution. In particular, I argue for setups with many relatively small islands, and I also show that compositional evolution may scale to the inter-island level. The two levels of evolution influence each other, and I analyze this interaction more deeply. Migrations profoundly change the local dynamics and stimulate evolution, which often ultimately results in better performance. I study the role of genetic operators in this behavior and also create mathematical models of after-migration dynamics. This analysis gives us a better understanding of mixing and the survival of genes locally, and these processes in turn determine the type and level of interaction between islands globally. Further, using island heterogeneity enhances the inter-island evolution. Following the study, I analyze IM behavior on a range of test problems, including two complex domains. This dissertation improves our understanding of the dynamics of IMs and suggests a qualitative change in the way we think about them. This perspective offers new guidelines for configuring IM parameters and opens new directions for future work.}

As a consequence, a wide range of efficient approximation algorithms have been developed. However, when such applications involve sensitive data about individuals, their privacy concerns are not automatically addressed. To remedy this problem, we propose a general and systematic study of differentially private submodular maximization. We present privacy-preserving algorithms for both monotone and non-monotone submodular maximization under cardinality, matroid, and p-extendible system constraints, with guarantees that are competitive with optimal. Along the way, we analyze a new algorithm for non-monotone submodular maximization, which is the first (even non-privately) to achieve a constant approximation ratio while running in linear time. We additionally provide two concrete experiments to validate the efficacy of these algorithms.}

	abstract     = {Adversarial attacks for discrete data (such as texts) have been proved significantly more challenging than continuous data (such as images) since it is difficult to generate adversarial samples with gradient-based methods. Current successful attack methods for texts usually adopt heuristic replacement strategies on the character or word level, which remains challenging to find the optimal solution in the massive space of possible combinations of replacements while preserving semantic consistency and language fluency. In this paper, we propose \textbf{BERT-Attack}, a high-quality and effective method to generate adversarial samples using pre-trained masked language models exemplified by BERT. We turn BERT against its fine-tuned models and other deep neural models in downstream tasks so that we can successfully mislead the target models to predict incorrectly. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art attack strategies in both success rate and perturb percentage, while the generated adversarial samples are fluent and semantically preserved. Also, the cost of calculation is low, thus possible for large-scale generations. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/LinyangLee/BERT-Attack}.}

	abstract     = {ABSTRACT We introduce a model for differentially private analysis of weighted graphs in which the graph topology $(V, E)$ is assumed to be public and the private information consists only of the edge weights $ w : E \rightarrow R^{+}$. This can express hiding congestion patterns in a known system of roads. Differential privacy requires that the output of an algorithm provides little advantage, measured by privacy parameters $\epsilon$ and $\delta$, for distinguishing between neighboring inputs, which are thought of as inputs that differ on the contribution of one individual. In our model, two weight functions $w,w^{'}$ are considered to be neighboring if they have $l_{1}$ distance at most one. We study the problems of privately releasing a short path between a pair of vertices and of privately releasing approximate distances between all pairs of vertices. We are concerned with the approximation error, the difference between the length of the released path or released distance and the length of the shortest path or actual distance. For the problem of privately releasing a short path between a pair of vertices, we prove a lower bound of $\Omega(|V|)$ on the additive approximation error for fixed privacy parameters $\epsilon$ and $\delta$. We provide a differentially private algorithm that matches this error bound up to a logarithmic factor and releases paths between all pairs of vertices, not just a single pair. The approximation error achieved by our algorithm can be bounded by the number of edges on the shortest path, so we achieve better accuracy than the worst-case bound for pairs of vertices that are connected by a low-weight path consisting of $o(|V|)$ vertices. For the problem of privately releasing all-pairs distances, we show that for trees we can release all-pairs distances with approximation error $O(log^{2.5} |V|)$ for fixed privacy parameters. For arbitrary bounded-weight graphs with edge weights in$ [0,M]$ we can release all distances with approximation error $O(\sqrt{|V|M}).$},

	abstract     = {Fitness sharing is a well-known diversity mechanism inspired by the idea that individuals in the population that are close to each other have to share their fitnesses in a similar way to how species in nature occupying the same ecological environment have to share resources. Thus, by derating the fitness of close individuals one hopes to encourage the population to spread out more. Previous runtime analyses of fitness sharing studied a variant where selection was based on populations instead of individuals. We study the conventional fitness sharing mechanism based on individuals and use runtime analysis to highlight its benefits and dangers on the well-known bimodal test problem TwoMax, where diversity is crucial for finding both optima. In contrast to population-based sharing, a (2+1) evolutionary algorithm (EA) with conventional fitness sharing does not guarantee to find both optima in polynomial time even when problem specific knowledge is used to estimate the distance between individuals; however, a (μ+1) EA with μ≥3 always succeeds in expected polynomial time. We further show theoretically and empirically that large offspring populations in (μ+λ) EA s can be detrimental as creating too many offspring in one particular area of the search space can make all individuals in this area go extinct. We conclude the paper with an empirical study indicating that similar conclusions may be drawn when using the genotypic distance that has to be relied upon when no problem specific knowledge is available.}

  abstract = 	 {This paper tackles the problem of adversarial examples from a game theoretic point of view. We study the open question of the existence of mixed Nash equilibria in the zero-sum game formed by the attacker and the classifier. While previous works usually allow only one player to use randomized strategies, we show the necessity of considering randomization for both the classifier and the attacker. We demonstrate that this game has no duality gap, meaning that it always admits approximate Nash equilibria. We also provide the first optimization algorithms to learn a mixture of classifiers that approximately realizes the value of this game, \emph{i.e.} procedures to build an optimally robust randomized classifier.}
