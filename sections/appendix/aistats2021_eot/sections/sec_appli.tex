\section{Examples}


\todo{When $c_i(x,y)$ represents the time to transport a unit of good $x$ to a unit of location $y$, then $\max_i\int c_i$ represents the total time to solve the transportation problem: MOT find the fastest way to transport the masses.} 
\todo{Minimise the biggest costs for N days to transport the goods.}
\todo{Matching professors and courses under multiples notations with equal contribution.}
\todo{Asymetric matching: stable mariages problem: in fact it is MOT}
\todo{Appli: learned costs and recomandations for new users using these learned costs}
