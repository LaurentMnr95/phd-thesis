The optimal 

\begin{definition}[Couplings between distributions] 
    Let $\ZZ$ be a Polish space. Let $\PP$ and $\QQ$ be two Borel probability distributions over $\ZZ$. The set of coupling distributions between $\PP$ and $\QQ$ is defined as:
    \begin{align*}
        \Gamma_{\PP,\QQ}:=\left\{\gamma\in\mathcal{M}^1_+(\ZZ^2)\mid~ \Pi_{1,\sharp}\gamma = \PP,~\Pi_{2,\sharp}\gamma = \QQ\right\}
    \end{align*}
where $\Pi_{i,\sharp}$ represents the push-forward of the projection on the $i$-th component.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Optimal Transport]
Let $\ZZ$ be a Polish space. Let $c:\ZZ\to\bar{\RR}_+$ be a lower semi-continuous non-negative function. Let $\PP$ and $\QQ$ be two  Borel probability distributions over $\ZZ$. The Optimal Transport problem or Wasserstein problem between $\PP$ and $\QQ$ associated with cost function $c$ is defined as:
\begin{align*}
    W_c(\PP,\QQ):=\inf_{\gamma\in\Gamma_{\PP,\QQ}}\int c(x,y) d\gamma(x,y) = \inf_{\gamma\in\Gamma_{\PP,\QQ}}\mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\sim\gamma}\left[c(x,y) \right]
\end{align*} 
\end{definition}
The infimum is attained.

\begin{thm}[Kantorovich duality]
    Let $\ZZ$ be a Polish space. Let $c:\ZZ\to\bar{\RR}_+$ be a lower semi-continuous non-negative function. Let $\PP$ and $\QQ$ be two Borel probability distributions over $\ZZ$. Then   the following strong duality theorem holds:
\begin{align*}
    W_c(\PP,\QQ)=\sup_{f,g\in C(\ZZ),~f\oplus g\leq c}   \int fd\PP+\int fd\QQ
\end{align*}
where for all $x,y\in\ZZ$, $f\oplus g(x,y):=f(x)+g(y)$.
\end{thm}


\subsection{Distributionally Robust Optimization}


Let us consider the following problem. Let $\ZZ$ and $\Theta$ be Polish spaces. Let $\PP$ be a Borel probability distribution over $\ZZ$. Let $f:\Theta\times\ZZ\to\RR$ be an upper semi continuous function in its second variable. Let us consider the following problem:
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:min-objective}
    \min_{\theta\in\Theta} \mathbb{E}_{z\sim\PP}\left[f(z)\right] = \min_{\theta\in\Theta} \int f(\theta,z)d\PP(z)
\end{align}



This problem can typically cast a risk minimization problem in Machine Learning when $\PP$ is a distribution over input-label pairs. A distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problem is a problem similar to Equation~\eqref{eq:min-objective}, but the learner aims at being robust to a change in the distribution $\PP$. Typically if $D$ is an uncertainty metric for distribubtions. Formally, the DRO problem is casted as follows:
\begin{align*}
    \min_{\theta\in\Theta}\sup_{\QQ\in\mathcal{M}^1_+(\ZZ)\mid~D(\PP,\QQ)\leq \varepsilon}\mathbb{E}_{z\sim\QQ}\left[f(z)\right]
\end{align*}
For instance, $D$ be a Kullback-Leibler etc CITE

In the case of Wasserstein uncertainty sets, let $c:\ZZ\to\bar{\RR}_+$ be a lower semi-continuous non-negative function. Then a  Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problem is defined as follows:
\begin{align*}
    \min_{\theta\in\Theta}\sup_{\QQ\in\mathcal{M}^1_+(\ZZ)\mid~W_c(\PP,\QQ)\leq \varepsilon}\mathbb{E}_{z\sim\QQ}\left[f(z)\right]
\end{align*}

Then we can define the Wasserstein balls as 
\begin{align*}
    \mathcal{B}_{c}(\PP,\eta) := \left\{\QQ\in \mathcal{M}^+_1(\mathcal{Z})\mid W_c(\PP,\QQ)\leq \eta\right\}
\end{align*}
\paragraph{Properties of Wasserstein balls.} The Wasserstein balls inherits from nice properties. Since $\QQ\mapsto  W_c(\PP,\QQ)$ is convex, they are convex sets. Moreover the function $\QQ\mapsto  W_c(\PP,\QQ)$ is lower semi-continuous for the narrow topology of measures, then the set $\mathcal{B}_{c}(\PP,\eta) $ is closed for the narrow topology too. Concerning the compactness of this set, if $\ZZ$ is compact then the set $\mathcal{B}_{c}(\PP,\eta) $ is also compact as a closed subset of the compact set $\mathcal{M}^+_1(\mathcal{Z})$.~\cite{yue2020linear} proved the compactness for $l^p$ distances. In general, compactness is a case by case question. 


\paragraph{Duality results} The problem of computing DRO solutions is difficult become it concerns optimization over distribution. A strong duality leading to a relaxation of the problem was proved by~\cite{blanchet2019quantifying}. We state this theorem as follows.


\begin{thm}[Duality for Wasserstein DRO]
    Let $\PP$ be a Borel probability distribution over $\ZZ$. Let $f:\ZZ\to\RR$ be an upper semi continuous function. Let $c:\ZZ\to\RR_+$ be a lower semi-continuous non-negative function. 
    \begin{align*}
        \sup_{\QQ\in\mathcal{M}^1_+(\ZZ)\mid~W_c(\PP,\QQ)\leq \varepsilon}\mathbb{E}_{z\sim\QQ}\left[f(z)\right] = \inf_{\lambda\geq 0}\mathbb{E}_{z\sim\PP}\left[\sup_{z'\in\ZZ}f(z')-\lambda c(z,z')\right] +\lambda\varepsilon
    \end{align*}
  
\end{thm}
